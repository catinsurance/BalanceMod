v0.1.2 //

- Fixed mod compatibility and numerous crashes and bugs

- Lemon Mishap has had it's damage increased back to 8 damage per tick.

- Fish Head will now activate regardless if the damage was self-inflicted or not. 

- Right now, Breath of Life no longer has its depletion rate and smaller charge due to a technical limitation.
    - This will be fixed in an update releasing tomorrow. 
    - I needed to get this update out ASAP.
    - Monstro's Tooth and Mom's Bottle of Pills have also had their charges reverted for the reason above.
